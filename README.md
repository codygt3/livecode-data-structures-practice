# livecode-data-structures-practice
There are two parts to this livecode, array and object practice.

## Array Practice
In arrays.js:

1. Create two arrays, one called **types** and one called **pokemon**.
2. Fill each of these arrays with at least three elements. One element should be empty.
3. console.log() each of your arrays to see how they look.
4. Find a way to log only the middle element in one of your arrays.

## Object Practice
In objects.js:

1. Create an object called pokemon. This object should have three properties, **name**, **type**, and **moves**.
2. Set the name property to "Pikachu"
3. Set the type property to "Electric"
4. Set the moves property to an array with at least two moves.
5. Find a way to log the moves array of the pokemon object.
6. Find a way to print out this message using dot notation:
```
“Pikachu is an Electric type”
```
7. Create a function in the pokemon object called speak, and have it log "Pika pika!"
